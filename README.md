I am 20 years old girl from Kyustendil, Bulgaria, but I'm currently living and studying in Sofia, Bulgaria. ðŸ‘©

I am currently studying in Technical University of Sofia. In school, I extensively study Math, Informatics and ICT.ðŸ’»

I have fundamental knowledge at JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also study at Software University (SoftUni) and gain new skills every day.

From my first touch to it, programming grabbed me. I like creating new things and developing new features. All technologies are very interesting to me and I want to learn more and more.
